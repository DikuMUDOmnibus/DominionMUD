the Cabal's guard~
An tough-looking veteran, armed to the teeth, stands here on guard duty.

The guard to the guildhouse of the Bleak Cabal is one of their better 
warriors so as not to have anyone not of the guild drop in.  He looks 
very tough and the sword in his hand is held with practiced ease.
