book~
     As you thumb through the pages, the leaves crack and break.
Much of the writing within is illegible, but all you read is
filled with dread.  Within are all of Melkor's cruel activities
preserved forever.  One passage catches your attention...
     "....captured thine great enemy, the mortal Hurin.  As per
     thy orders, he hast been set upon the rock...."
You read on nervously...
     "...a man of great might, well learned in the wisdom of
     the Elves.  Perhaps he can give thee the Eldar's courses
     for regaining that which thou hast freed and taken unto
     thyself.  The Silmarils are greatly...."
As you read the line, the page crumbles into dust.
