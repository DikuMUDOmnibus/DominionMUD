With a gleaming head and a edge that is razor sharp, you know that this
weapon must have been forged by a man who's skills rivaled the gods.  The
handle is hewn from an ironwood tree and laced with solid steel, giving

book~
The book flares up once and opens itself to a marked page.  Your eyes 
adjust to the glare, and you see the following words shimmer into place:

"The whip that the weaponsmith forged was a legacy to his works.  Made from
 barbed links, it was used as the symbol of power in the underdark with 
 the Dargonae races.  When the disciple of Garou known as Gangrel left the
 homeland, he stole the whip and raced away.  Pursued by his outraged 
 kin, the drow pitched the whip into a passing carrage, bound for the seas
 on the outskirts of The Dominion.  Whether or not the drow were able to 
 recover their trophy, the fact remains that some still say that the weapon
 is indeed in their hands.  Others maintain it is somewhere across the rivers
 but as to where, no one seems to know....."

And with a blur of soft light, the words vanish and the book closes.

Bristling with power from head to handle, Skullcrusher is a masterpiece
of a weapon.  Twenty barbs, sharpened to a razor point, lance through the
head of the mace, giving the club a decidedly deadly look and feel.  You
feel much better having it to point at people....rather than the other way
around.

Heartseeker's blade is indeed covered with runes.  After looking at them for
a few moments, you assume that they must be magical symbols, placed upon it
to aid its wielder in combat.  The handle looks to be made out of a mixture
of metal and wood....though how in Glasgian's name any weaponsmith was able
to perform THAT feat, you don't know.
