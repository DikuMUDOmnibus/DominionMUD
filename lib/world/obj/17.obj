do not cast spells, but the trees that "moan" do.

encyclopedia book z~
   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
Z. Some of the entries look like these:
Zombie Master- a really cool guy that goes around taking care of those nasty
   smelling corpses that adventurers leave lying around all of the time.
Zweihander- a large, heavy, sword that does a lot of damage. Unfortunately,
   most people can not pick up this rather heavy weapon.
