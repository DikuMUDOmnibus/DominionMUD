note~
	Karak,
	     I am quite displeased with the
	progress of the mining operation.
	I must have the AmberStone 
	immediately!  Also, our allies have
	redoubled their pressure for a
	route of invasion of the surface
	world.  
     I expect you will correct
	the situation....

As you gaze into the glowing Amberstone, you curse your mortal bones that 
cannot lift it from its resting place, let alone harness its raw power.
