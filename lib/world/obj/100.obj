crystal ball~
The quest of the Overseer.  This probably wont be too much fun for
people over 20 or so.  In fact if anyone over level 25 comes to me
with the completed quest I won't accept it and you wont get rewarded.

Anyways...You must collect the 4 crystal balls and take them to the hermit
errr where the last crystal ball says for u to take it.  If the mob that
the last ball mentions doesnt respond just be really loud, pray to the gods
whatever....wait until i get there basically.  I may not be on so you'll have
to wait i guess.  

Anyhow...your first clue to find the second ball (the ball besides this one)
is this:  Deep in the heart of Sir-dem-Ir-Lesk
