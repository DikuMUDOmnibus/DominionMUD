  mpecho The back wall of ths shop seems to flicker and change.
  mpecho Suddenly, an enchanting vista is splayed before you
  mpecho filled with flowers, lush, green hills, and sunlight.
  mpecho You have the urge to plunge into the splendorous place
  mpecho but just as quickly as it appeared, it disappears,
  mpecho leaving only the plain far wall of the shop.

  mpecho $I fiddles with a wand that won't seem to work.
  say Damnit, work! You god forsaken piece of driftwood.
  mpecho Suddenly, with a burst of color, the wand springs to life.
  mpecho The old mage is hit with a blast of color,
  mpecho leaving his face hued with the colors of the rainbow.
  mpecho Then the wand seems to fall back to sleep.
  mpecho $I swears with words you don't know and puts the wand in his robe.

  mpecho $I sits down at his desk and pages through a small, red book.
  say Ah-ha!  
  mpecho $I begins to scribble something down on a scroll.

  say Want to see something amazing?
  mpecho The old mage raises his hands high and utters, 'Kilmzarhgggh'.
  mpecho A flash of blinding light illuminates the room.
  mpecho When you can see again, instead of the mage before you,
  mpecho a chicken is on the floor, pecking and sqwacking.
  mpecho Then in a puff of smoke the mage reappears cursing.
  say Maybe next time.
