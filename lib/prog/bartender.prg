    mpecho Suddenly you see a bottle come from out of nowhere and smash
    mpecho against the Red Guard's head.

   mpecho Suddenly a brawl breaks out!
   mpecho Two men smash the hell out of each other with their
   mpecho beer muds which two others kick another man lying
   mpecho in a puddle of grime.  Suddenly a dark figure strides
   mpecho towards the fracas and slashes two throats with his dagger
   mpecho and leaves a short sword in the back of the man on the floor.
   mpecho Then as quick as he came, he leaves the tavern.
