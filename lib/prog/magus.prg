>greet_prog 50~
   say You have entered the domain of the Mage.
   say If you need help, please ask.
~
>speech_prog help~
   say First, tell me what you seek help with - Would you like to know  
   say more about spheres, or general help?
~
>speech_prog general~
   say Well, the powers of the mage are quite strong after much
   say study and honing of your powers.  Magic flows through us all
   say like a river, you must learn to harness this great river of
   say magic.
~
>speech_prog sphere spheres sph~
   say A sphere is another way of saying field of study.  You may
   say train in any field of study you like but will most likely
   say never become truly proficient if you just practice this and that.
   say The only way a mage becomes a wizard is through dedication
   say and patience.  I teach the first steps of harnessing the
   say powers of Thaumaturgy.  After I teach you the basics, you must
   say seek out others who can train you further.  
   say Do you wish to know more about Thaumaturgy?
~
>speech_prog yes~
   say there are 6 different subspheres of Thaumaturgy - Enchantment,
   say Phantasm, Entropy, Invocation, Divination, and conjuration.
   say Which one would you like to know more about?
~
>speech_prog conjuration~
   say Conjuration is the art of weaving a spell which will open
   say a portal to a parallel world and bring a creature from that
   say world to ours.  There is an ancient woman in the Serdim-ir-Lesk
   say Valley who can help you.  Seek her.
~
>speech_prog enchantment enchant~
   say this is the most basic sphere for any beginning spell caster.
   say It holds both offensive and defensive spells as well as some
   say other tricks which can aid you.  Seek out one of my pets in
   say Darkweir...it is half bird, and half horse.
~
>speech_prog phantasm~
   say Phantasm deals with the supernatural areas of Magic.  As of
   say yet, there are no trainers for this sphere.
~
>speech_prog entropy entropic~
   say This cruel study of anatomy is often frowned upon by society.
   say It deals with necromancy - a black art of the Mage Circle.
   say There is only one man who knows enough about this sphere -
   say and you would be very unwise to seek him out - The Vivi-
   say sectionist.  His whereabouts are unknown to me - you may wish
   say to enquire with the some of the more shady sorts near the Grog
   say and Tankard.
~
>speech_prog invocation~
   say Ah!  My long lost brother is or was, depending on whether he
   say lives this day, quite proficient in the Art of Invocation.  One
   say day, many many ages ago, he left Elrhinn to find the lost Tower
   say of Mages.  Some say he disappeared into the Shadow Grove...
   say if you find him please tell him I think of him often and await
   say his return.
~
>speech_prog divin div divination~
   sigh
   say I once was the teacher of a young gypsy.  She grew more and more
   say interested in Divination and finally lost herself in it.  She
   say destroyed her physical sight but is said to be able to see the
   say the future of mankind within her mind.  She is now a seeress -
   say wandering the streets of Elrhinn.
