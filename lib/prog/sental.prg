   nod
   say Combat Proficiency is the art of the warrior.  Only those with

   say succeed.  It is broken down into three areas, Hand to Hand, 
   say Weapons Proficiency, and Martial Arts.

   say Hand to Hand, you will begin to learn the most basic skills of
   say the warrior.  These will stay with you throughout the years as 
   say the backbone of your training.  To learn more about this, seek
   say out my friend, and comrade in arms, I believe he was last
   say seen on a small quest of sorts in the Darkweir Hallows.

>speech_prog training~
   say To train a skill or sphere, simply 'practice' it.  
~
>speech_prog weapons proficiency~
   say This is one of the warriors greatest arts.  The ability to
   say handle and wield many different weapons with great skill.  To
   say learn more in this sphere, seek out the Elven Champion in
   say the Elven Village which is somewhere in Pelarrine Forest.

>speech_prog martial arts~
   say Martial Arts is a complex sphere which deals more with the
