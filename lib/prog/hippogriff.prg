  mpecho $I utters a strange word, 'Erifkcalb', and an image 
  mpecho is suddenly hovering before you.
  mpecho ...
  mpecho An elven warrior is travelling through the woods alone
  mpecho adorned with a silverleaf upon his dark-blue armor. 
  mpecho Suddenly the elf is waylaid by ogres and left to die
  mpecho stripped of all of his armor.
  mpecho ...
  say The spirit of this young elf still wanders these Hallows.
  say His soul is in anguish...

>give_prog silverleaf~
  say The silverleaf is part of the elf, it is where his
  say spirit dwelled.  He cannot pass on without it...
  say Maybe Ardanin knows....
  shake
~
>speech_prog ardanin~
  say I know not whether he lives or has passed on...
  say He was once a great mage, though sometimes
  say a bit muddled between the way of the gnome
  say and the way of the wizard.  Where he
  say is...remains a mystery...
