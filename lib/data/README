This directory contains text files for enhancing various facets of the
MUD.  You can add new races to the 'races' file by following the
provided format.  The same goes for new religions, with the
'religions' file.  Also, if you don't like the amounts of experience
necessary to advance in levels, just modify the file called
'exp_table'.

TODO:
