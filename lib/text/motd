* The Dominion experienced a file systems failure and lost several
  areas  that were never backed-up.  Sorry for any inconvieniences.

* Read the POLICY please.

* Thanks to all of you that have been playing religiously!  We're always
  working hard on the game to make it better for you.  Please send your
  ideas, no matter how dumb or complicatedy ou may think they may be,
  to mountcas@pluto.ee.cua.edu and if we think it'll work out, we'll put
  it in.  Also, PLEASE advertise on your favorite BBS and with friends
  etc.

* There is no CONSIDER command...use STUDY instead!

* We currently have a low player base right now...Grab a friend, get 
  them mudding!

* The new version of the mud will be up soon.  We will be needing player
  testers for it (plays a lot different from the current version).

* Join a guild, or heck, make one if you dont like any that exist 
  (type help guild for more info)

* Most of all, have fun, that is why we are here.
