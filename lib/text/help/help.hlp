AGE

Your age is based on your race.  Some races live much longer than other, 
and therefore mature at different rates.  A dwarf can live nearly 200 years
and will reach maturity at 69 rather than human who will reach his maturity

#
ALIAS ALIASES

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

> alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

> alias gbb get bread bag
> alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

> alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

> alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.  For example:

> alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
> killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

> alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

> alias tr tell rasmussen $*
> tr hi there, how are you today?
You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

#
ALIGNMENT

Your alignment plays a crucial role in your character's abilities.
You picked a permanent align during your character's generation which
will stay that align.  You also have a current align which changes
depending on the alignment of the monsters/players you kill.  
Ie. If you kill Satan (alignment = -1000) your alignment will fall
drastically.  

If your current align falls out of line with the perm align you will
probably not be able to cast or pray for spells.

Some religions will not accept you if your align differs from that
god's alignment (which can be found if you type 'affirm').

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

> color off
This command disables all color.

> color sparse
> color normal
> color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

Temporarily Disabled Color Codes that you will be able to insert into any
text are:

   Modifiers:
   %N/%n - Normal Text   %B/%b - Bold Text   %F/%f - Faint Text
   %U/%u - Underline (May not work on your screen)
   %I/%i - Blinking/Flashing Text            %R/%r - Reverse Text

   Foreground Colors:
   %0 - Black (Invis)    %1 - Red            %2 - Green
   %3 - Brown            %4 - Blue           %5 - Magenta

ATTRIBUTES

    The allocation of system helps you create a more unique character.
The * represents the amount of points you currently have on that stat.
To raise a certain stat, simply type a plus (+) and then the key letter
in the bracket of the target attribute.  To lower an attribute place
a minus (-) before the keyletter.

    Each race has a different set of predetermined attributes.  For
instance, a human has all average stats.  But a half-giant, would have
an above average strength yet below average intelligence.  So the
attributes will be determined and shown accordingly.

    To learn the certain spheres you need to have some basic pre-requisite
attributes.

Combat Proficiency              - High Strength and High Constitution
General                         - All Attributes Average.
Thaumaturgy                     - High Intelligence and High Dexterity
Theomachy                       - High Wisdom and High Will Power

The Do's
--------
1. Talk to Grendel or Kirahn before you do anything.
2. Have your area planned out before you begin writing rooms/mobs/etc.
3. Make a map to help you out.
4. Try to keep syntax errors to a minimum.
5. Write a colorful description.

The Dont's

1. Don't make silly names for rooms, areas, mobs, objs. Keep it serious.
2. Don't put actions in the descriptions.  
3. Don't put people in room descs.
4. Don't put speech into a description.
5. Don't copy rooms too often (don't make the same room desc over and over)

   and dont make DT's silly; ex., You have just walked out a window and
   fall to your doom!  No one would walk out a window in reality.

Just try to put a lot of flavor into what you are doing but keep it
concise.  Make the players exploring your zone get the feeling that
they can picturize where they are by your descriptions.

GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]
	GROUP all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

GUILDS GUILD

   Guilds play an important role in the everyday life of The Dominion.
No longer will you just go to a guild for the sole purpose of gaining and
training.  Each guild has it's own basic philosophy on how life should be
led.  Some guilds are evil, some are fanatics, some are loremasters, some
are filled with death dealing assassins.  Each guild is run by a guild leader
who can 'advance' and 'accept' more members.  If you are in a guild,
type GUILD without any arguments to see who is in your guild, type
GUILD <messg> to chat between members of your guild.  It is ILLEGAL
for ANY Immortals to be in a guild, interefere with any guild policy
(except Kirahn who is allowed to do anything he wishes), or have
a mortal character as a guild leader.  If any immortals are caught
breaking this rule, they will be demoted or deleted altogether.

#
RANKS

Each guild has several different ranks.  The guild leader may advance

The HOUSE command is used to add or remove guests from your house's guest
list.  You must be standing in your house to use this command.  Only the
primary owner of a house (not guests) may change the guest list using the
HOUSE command.

Usage: house [<player name>]

Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on
your house's guest list.  Typing 'house' with the name of a player will add
that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, or will
remove the player from the guest list if the player is already on the list.
The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD, although
he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.

Guests of your house will be able to enter your house until you remove them

INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

Inns are places where the weary traveller may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTRE will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

NEWBIE NEWBIES

   A newbie is anyone from level 1 - 5.  They cannot pkill or be pkilled.
Newbies start out with the bare essentials here at The Dominion to aid
them in their rise of power and glory.
   Darkweir Hallows is an ancient forest south of Elrhinn designated
especially for new players.  There they can find monsters to kill as well
as some more items that can help them out.  Even though it is a place for
newbies to learn the basics of fighting and is relatively easy, it is
still a dangerous place.  It may be wise to seek out other newbies
and form a party to venture into the dark hallows.
   Newbies also have the added bonus of being able to type 'recall' or
'/' to bring them right back to the Elrhinn Town Square, it is hoped that
this will give newbies the incentive to go out and explore.

#
HUMAN

Human :  The standard race in The Dominion.  No class restrictions, no level
limitations, hail from all parts of this reality.  Once the most numerous of
the races, the human species has slowly levelled out with the other types of
creatures and now finds themselves not atop the ladder of sheer numbers, but
on the same rung as everyone else.  Tall, short, skinny, robust, powerful,
weak, intelligent, stupid: all shapes and sizes and consequently, that makes
them the most adaptable race in The Dominion.

No bonuses.  No minuses.  No affections of any kind.
#
ARMACHNAE "HIGH ELF"

This race of elves prides themselves in being that of A purer strain than the
rest.  Taller and slender than the other tribes, the Armachnaen Elves devote
most of their time to study and mental abilities, seeing hand-to-hand combat
as barbaric.  Often pale, with fair hair, this race exists on the surface of
the land, but withdraws from other groups, so as not to defile themselves.
They make solid clerics, druids, and good mages.

Bonuses:    +1 Int / +1 Wis    Minuses: -1 Str / -1 Con
Affections: None
#
TARMIRNAE "GREY ELF"

Over 2000 years ago, a split occurred within the High Elf city where one
faction stressed staying pure to their roots while the other advocated a
mingling with other races.  The "Grey Elves", as the Tarmirnae came to be
called, were banished from the Armachnaen society.  Making their home in the
forests, these elves are well-rounded individuals who delight in learning
new things when they can.  Somewhat shorter than their fellow elves, many
are dark-haired and of a darker shade of skin.

Bonuses:  +1 Wis    Minuses:  -1 Con
Affections: 50% chance of infravision.
#
RADINAE "WILD ELF"

A lost race of The Dominion, these Elves have remained hidden, until now.
Savage, nomadic, and tough, the Wild Elves are scorned by their fellows as
barbaric and stupid.  But this group isn't as incompetent as one might think.
Most are tall, muscular, and tan from all the time spent outdoors.  The
Radinae make excellent fighters and rangers, gaining a slight bonus in
ability if either are chosen as a way of life.

Bonuses:  +1 Con / +1 Dex    Minuses: -2 Int / -2 Cha
Affections: Automatic Infravision.
#
DROW "DARK ELF" DARGONAE

Once thought to be a legend, this race of elves is a reality that some wish
hadn't come true.  Living for most of their lives below the surface of the
earth, the Drow are one of the few races that is almost totally evil as a
people.  Some have strayed from their blood-thirsty ways of life, and still
more have left their homeland and chosen to walk on the surface.  White-
haired and dark-skinned, the Dargonae are normally shunned by all other
species in The Dominion.  They make excellent thieves and fighters, gaining
minor bonuses if chosen.

Bonuses:  +2 Dex / +1 Int     Minuses: -1 Str / -1 Con / -1 Cha
Affections: Automatic Infravision.
#
THURGAR

Clan Thurgar :  Much like the High Elves, this race of dwarves has been the
ruling class for thousands of years, holding complete control on the rest of
the clans with an iron fist.  Very wise and very hardy, they treat most other
races with respect and honor, both of these things being intrinsic to the
dwarven way of life.  Most members of this clan distrust magic, which is why
minor subtractions occur if that class is picked.

Bonuses:  +2 Str / +2 Con     Minuses: -1 Dex
Affections: Resistant to some magic.
#
DAERWAR

Clan Daerwar :  These dwarves believe that in knowledge, lies strength, and
so the Daerwar have naturally studied every scrap of knowledge that they
could find in The Dominion.  Magic and spellcrafting are intrinsic to their
way of life, for without the Art, they have no purpose; nothing to strive
for.  Easily picked out from their brothers and sisters by the ritual scars
that decorate their hands, this race is one to be reckoned with at higher
levels as they are extremely potent in magic.

Bonuses:    +2 Wis / +1 Int    Minuses: -1 Dex / -1 Con / -1 Cha
Affections: Spell strength increases at very high levels.
#
KAERGAR

Clan Kaergar :  This holy order of the dwarves is a strong one, so strong
in fact, that their numbers rival that of the Thurgar.  Believing that
religion and belief are intrinsic to strength, the Kaergar concentrate
them-selves on only a few professions, but their powers in those classes
are considerable.  Be it the Order of Kirahn, the Religion of Glasgian, or
the Tribe of the Kinnslayer, this race is made up of crusaders and devout
worshippers, worthy foes one and all.

Bonuses:  +1 Wis / +2 Con    Minuses:  -1 Dex / -1 Cha
#
ZAKHAR

Clan Zakhar :  A small race of dwarves from the south-eastern mountains
known as the Fallorian Cliffs, the Zakhar are the dwarven counterpart to
the Drow race.  Delighting in bloodshed, torture, and black magic, this
vile race has been persecuted and hunted by their fellow brothers to the
point of near genocide.  Today, less than 1000 remain, but in their reduced
numbers, the Zakhar have found strength and will one day rise up again to
wreak havoc on dwarven society and take their revenge. . . . .

Bonuses: +1 Str / +1 Con     Minuses:  -3 Cha
#
KENDER

An offbreed of the Halfling society, these troublemakers are one of the most
annoying races found in The Dominion.  Short in stature, light on their feet,
and devoid of guilt, the Kender constantly find themselves in trouble and
adventure.  While not especially powerful clerics or mages, Kender are born
thieves with high dexterity and good wisdom scores.  Sadly, there is no way
to shut them up, so if one tags along on a journey, be prepared for a non-
stop stream of chatter.

Bonuses:  +3 Dex / +1 Wis     Minuses: -2 Str / -1 Con / -1 Cha
Affections: Automatic Infravision,  Immunity to Fear.
#
HALFLINGS HALFLING

Distant cousins of the dwarves and reluctant brothers to the Kender, the
Halfling society in The Dominion isn't a large one.  Short, independent,
and very quick on their feet.  Most have a love for the outdoors, which
makes them good rangers with a solid dexterity and good constitution ratings.
The bonus to dexterity can also be used in the most chosen guild for
Halflings, the thief.  Though not universally loved, they're not universally
hated either.

Bonuses:  +3 Dex / +1 Con      Minuses: -2 Str / -1 Cha
Affections: Automatic Infravision.
#
HALF-GIANT

Large, brutish, and ugly, the giants of The Dominion love a good fight.
Barbaric in nature, they are some of the strongest creatures alive.  This
brutal instinct is rarely held in check since their intelligence leaves
something to be desired.  Most are simple fighters, but a few have picked up
on the art of spell-casting and fight as rangers.

Bonuses: +3 Str / +3 Con    Minuses: -2 Wis / -3 Int / -3 Cha
Affections: None
#
CENTAURS

Half-horse and half-man, these fun-loving nomads are surprisingly intelligent.
Lovers of nature and masters of woodland spellcasting, they make some of the
best druids and rangers in The Dominion.  The Centaurs don't believe in
cliques or tribes, all are one under their way of life.  Consequently,
most all of them worship the God of Nature, Garou.  Although some follow
Glasgian or Sand.  All in all, the philosophy of the centaur is to have a
good time, to which they do with abandon!

Bonuses:  +2 Dex / +1 Str     Minuses: -1 Cha / -1 Int
Affections: Sense Life
#
SESSANATHI LIZARD-MAN

Twisted, lizard-man beasts, this race was a product of Kirahn's twisted
imagination.  Several thousand men and woman were forced to undergo a
horrific type of metamorphosis that changed them into dragonspawn.
They are shunned all over The Dominion by the original races, and are
all believed to be evil incarnate.

Bonuses:    +1 Str / +2 Wis       Minuses: -1 Dex / -3 Cha
Affections: None
#
ATHASIANAE "HALF ELVES" "HALF ELF"

Usually the product of Wild Elves and humans, the Athasianae are a species
with no culture to call their own.  Most Elven tribes and sects routinely
shun them, while the human population with their normal distrust of elvish
things, also tend to shut the half-elves out.  So with persecution on all
sides, this race has better survival tactics than any other in The Dominion.
With human blood, they don't lose the point of Con that most other elves do.
The only way to really identify them from humans is the pointed ears that
most grow their hair long to hide.

Bonuses:    +1 Dex / +1 Con     Minuses:  -1 Cha
Affections: None.
#
HALF-OGRE

This race is one to be reckoned with.  Tall, slimmer than ogres but much
bigger than humans, the half-ogres gain the best aspects of both species,
with the added intelligence of a human to the brutal strength of the ogres.
Most dwell in the northern mountains with the snow and the polar bears,
but they love to travel, rarely staying in one place for any length of time.
As a result, they can be found in cities and towns, although that is not to
say that they are especially well treated.  Due to a genetic deficiency, all
members of this race, male and female, are bald.

Bonuses:    +1 Str / +2 Con      Minuses:  -1 Int / -1 Wis / -1 Cha
Affections: None.
#
QUINTALS KINTHALAS "KINTHALASIAN MINOTAURS"

The larger clan of the minotaur race, this is the species most general-
isations are made from.  The Kinthalasian way is that of war and fighting.
To gain rank and status in their society, you must fight your way there, or
die trying.  Intelligent, strong, and quick, they can fight easily with their
bare hands or with weapons, depending on what is needed or close at hand.
Located on a small peninsula on the western reaches of The Dominion, few
have ever seen their homeland, as they routinely kill all intruders.  Strict
and militaristic, a single minotaur is a fearsome opponent.  Several would
be close to unstoppable. . . .

Bonuses:    +2 Str / +2 Con     Minuses: -1 Wis / -1 Cha
Affections: Ability to "gore" opponents.
#
BYTERIAN "BYTERIAN MINOTAUR"

The smaller of the two sects, the Byterian Minataurs  have forgone the
militaristic way of life for one of study and purification.  Honor, loyalty,
and mental and physical unity are what they strive for.  Routinely scorned
for their beliefs by the Kinthalasians, the Byterians still are worthy
opponents as they mix mental abilities with physical ones.  Almost all of
them are either monks or clerics, but a few look for union in other guilds.
The Byterians are easily spotted from their brothers by their more slender
builds, smaller horns, and the 4 earrings of emerald, sapphire, ruby, and
stone that are worn in the left ears of the clan.

Bonuses:    +2 Str / +1 Con    Minuses:  -1 Cha
Affections: Ability to "gore" opponents.
#
GNOME GNOMES GNOMISH

Gnomes are a race of short, thin, frail people.  They have the ability to
see in the dark, and are exceptionally perceptive.  This perception aids
them in the casting of spells, and thus they make very good spell-casters.
Yet their poor constitutions and strengths limit their usefulness as
fighters.
#
MINOTAUR MINOTAURS

Minotaurs are a race of half-man, half-bull people.  They are a very
proud, and thus very stubborn people.  They are very strong and stoic,
yet not as dextrous as other races, also due to their unyielding
stubbornness, they are also not as wise as some other races.  Though
Minotaurs do not gain mana very well, they are able to take a tremendous
amount of damage and still keep going.  Due to their extraordinary
olfactory senses they can sense life within 5 yards of them.

See Also KINTHALAS BYTERIAN
#
ELVES ELF

The elves of The Dominion are, with the exception of the Drow, are a tall,
slim people.  They all have the chance to see in the dark and most races of
elf gain bonuses in dexterity at the expense of constitution.

#
ROLEPLAYING RP

   Role-playing is a term used in many different sorts of activities
dating a long way back.  Most commonly used in Drama.  In drama, role-
playing is the key to putting on a good performance.  The actors and
actresses roleplay by putting themselves 'into the minds' of the character
they are going to play.  If done well, the audience is thrilled to see
such believable actors.
   In The Dominion, we wish for you to Roleplay as well.  No one can tell
you how to roleplay but they can all feel it.  Read the help on races and
pay attention to how your race acts and the short history that belongs to
your race.  For example, if you are a kender, small yet fearless, cunning
yet annoying, you must try to think like the kender would think.  Speak
loudly for no damn reason when your party is trying to sneak up on a known
assassin.  Kender get themselves into trouble a lot.  See what you can do
to cause some harmless trouble.  If you happen to be a brutish half-ogre,
think how an ogre looks and acts in your mind then try to become that ogre.
They lumber along with their clubs dragging on the ground as the clomp
noisily through the brush.  They speak slowly and not the most intelligent
beings in The Dominion.
   Above all, the most important part of roleplaying is this:  Never
play another character of yours the same way you play another.  Every
different character has his own lifestyle and history.  Become someone
else with each character you have.

SAVE

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT YELL HOLLER OOC GOSSIP '

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

<say | shout | holler> <string>
<tell | whisper | ask> <player> <string>

> say Hey, does anyone know how to get to the Adarkar Wastes?
> tell uncle hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in: ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.  Holler
broadcasts to everyone in the game but costs 20 movement points.  You must
be level 2 before you can use shout and yell.

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop
by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers
are often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed,
surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

MAGIC

Spells play an integral part in The Dominion.  Many mages have perfected
spells which will be used for combat or a myriad of other things which
require a magical touch.  Clerics, druids, rangers, mages, and even monks
get different kinds of spells to assist them in the harsh world of The
Dominion.

You cannot know what spells you will have in the future anymore.

If there is a problem with any spell, please be sure to use the
'bug' command to report it.  Also if you have an idea for a new spell or
would like to see a spell implemented that is on another MUD, use the
'idea' command.

"SPHERE" "SPHERES"

   The Dominion is now a classless realm.  If you type sphere you will access
a general list of the 5 basic spheres you may attempt to train in.  You can
train in any sphere you wish, but be warned you will only be able to train
to a certain point based upon your attributes.  Ex. If you have a strength
of 17 and an intelligence of 10 you will be able to train in the sphere of
combat to a much higher proficiency than you would in the sphere of arcana.
Within each of the 5 basic spheres (Combat, Thaumaturgy, Theomachy, Thievery,
and General Knowledge) there are sub-spheres.  Ex.  If you practice combat
enough you will notice that you can now train hand to hand combat.  The
more you practice the basic 'combat' sphere the better you will be able
to train the Hand to Hand sub-sphere.  The subspheres contain skills which
help in everyday life.

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently can not be strung.

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

"Weapons Proficiency"

This sub-sphere of Combat Proficiency holds skills which make your combat
much more....proficient :)  Swords, Daggers, polearms, and blunt weapons
all do the same thing pretty much depending on the type of weapon you
are currently wielding.  If you know 'swords' and are wielding a sword,
you will hit much more often, if you know 'blunt weapons' but are not 
wielding a hammer, or other bludgeoning weapon, you will not hit as often.

#
WEAR

If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.

Also, to wear everything in your inventory (or at least try to, as wearing
things like loaves of bread is not a good way to win friends and influence
people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

> wear boots
> wear all.bronze
> wear all
> wear ring finger

The Dominion was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to The Dominion is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to The Dominion in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Danny Baker, for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Brett Turner, for managing the The Dominion Mailing List.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven, for porting the code to the Amiga.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns, for allowing Circle to exist.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- And, of course, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!
