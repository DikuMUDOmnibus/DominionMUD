---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is not a fully complete list of what all has been added to The Dominion
in the last couple months by any means. Not included are over 20 zones which
have been added, and many many other features which we have forgotten to
list, but will be added to the list in further compilations. And remember,
ideas are always welcome!  Use the boards, or the idea command and your
ideas will be heard, and if they are good ideas, most likely implemented.
Thanks!
