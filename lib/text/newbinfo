The gods, implementors and site providers (henceforth The Dominion) provide 
these facilities for the public's enjoyment.  The Dominion assumes no 
liability for the statements or actions made by people who log in, nor do 
the opinions expressed by any person necessarily represent the opinions of 
The Dominion.

Users of these facilities agree to abide by the rules and regulations of
The Dominion.  Users are also informed that all actions are subject to being
watched and/or logged by The Dominion.  The Dominion reserves the right to 
limit or prohibit the use of these facilities to any person at any time

Users of The Dominion are informed that The Dominion attempts to maintain an 
upscale and adult-oriented atmosphere.  The Dominion recognizes that the 
possibility for offensive or "indecent" textual material to be displayed to 
users of The Dominion exists.  We have voluntarily given ourselves an adult 
rating.

As The Dominion makes no effort to censor either the individual player's
statements or actions, nor the textual depictions of violence, and in light
of recent legislation (cf. Communications Decency Act of 1996), The Dominion
is now forced to deny entree to any player known to be under the age of 18
years.  Any player known to be under 18 years will be denied further access
to the best of The Dominion's abilities.

Furthermore, The Dominion recognizes that certain users may engage in unwanted 
or offensive actions toward other users.  The Dominion in no way assumes
responsibilities for such actions, but retains the right to sanction said
user when such actions come to The Dominion's attention.


If you are under the age of 18, do not wish to follow our policy, or 
easily offended, please type ^] (control + ]) and disconnect now.  
Otherwise, by pressing RETURN you agree to abide by the rules of The 
Dominion and not to hold the development team accountable for any 
materials you may find offensive.
