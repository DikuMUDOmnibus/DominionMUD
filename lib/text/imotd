	Please make a mortal and help test!

	I know there are alot of bugs right now, but let's first 
concentrate on the crash bugs, then move on to the lesser demons.

	There has been a change to the Handbook.  You are now
allowed to have a mortal - but no multiplaying and no buffing up
your mortal so that it can kick any other mortal's ass.

	Thanks.  Please mail any bugs reports to 
mountcas@pluto.ee.cua.edu (but I'll still be checking the bugs file too).
